# U-Net-Architecture-Implementation
#*Project Objective*
The goal of this project is to implement a U-Net model for binary segmentation of grayscale images that simulate medical images (like scans with tumors, organs, or other features). Although this version uses randomly generated synthetic data, it mirrors the architecture and workflow used in real-world medical image segmentation tasks.

# *Technologies Used*
Python 3
TensorFlow/Keras – for defining and training the deep learning model.
NumPy – for data creation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib – for visualizing predictions.
scikit-learn – for splitting data into training and validation sets.

 #*Optimized Training Strategy*
To ensure efficient training and avoid overfitting, the following optimization techniques were incorporated:
✅ Techniques Used
Early Stopping: Monitors the validation loss and stops training if there's no improvement for a defined number of epochs.
Model Checkpointing: Saves the best model (based on validation performance) during training.
Learning Rate Scheduling: Reduces the learning rate when the model hits a plateau, helping it converge better.
